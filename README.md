# Preface to the First Edition
Some thirty years ago it was still possible, as Lo`eve so ably demonstrated,
to write a single book in probability theory containing practically everything
worth knowing in the subject. The subsequent development has been explosive,
and today a corresponding comprehensive coverage would require a whole
library. Researchers and graduate students alike seem compelled to a rather
extreme degree of specialization. As a result, the subject is threatened by
disintegration into dozens or hundreds of subﬁelds.

At the same time the interaction between the areas is livelier than ever,
and there is a steadily growing core of key results and techniques that every
probabilist needs to know, if only to read the literature in his or her own ﬁeld.
Thus, it seems essential that we all have at least a general overview of the
whole area, and we should do what we can to keep the subject together. The
present volume is an earnest attempt in that direction.

My original aim was to write a book about “everything.” Various space
and time constraints forced me to accept more modest and realistic goals for
the project. Thus, “foundations” had to be understood in the narrower sense
of the early 1970s, and there was no room for some of the more recent developments.
I especially regret the omission of topics such as large deviations,
Gibbs and Palm measures, interacting particle systems, stochastic diﬀerential
geometry, Malliavin calculus, SPDEs, measure-valued diﬀusions, and branching
and superprocesses. Clearly plenty of fundamental and intriguing material
remains for a possible second volume.
